Miller won't hear his name called as early as former Buffaloes offensive lineman Nate Solder, who was selected 17th overall by New England in the 2011 draft, but he could be a nice mid-round pick-up by a team looking for depth up front. Miller has great size and a work ethic that is just as big. The native of Littleton, Colo., graded out at 83.3 as a senior, allowing just one sack and committing two penalties. Miller was an All-Big 12 honorable mention as a junior after playing every snap on offense, starting all 12 games at right guard. He graded out at 88.9 percent and yielded two sacks that season while getting whistled for two penalties. Miller was granted an extra year of eligibility after missing a majority of the 2008 season with a broken fibula. He ha  long arms and does a nice job controlling defenders, but there are concerns that he could be at a leverage disadvantage in the run and pass game. Miller, though, has shown good footwork and can pull from the backside to deliver hits on targets. At the NFL combine  Miller recorded 32 reps in the bench press and showed some nice athletic ability in the vertical jump (28 inches) and bro d jump (100 inches).

Even if children and teens could be motivated to engage in some kind of phy ical activity, many schools have eliminated gym classes, and poor neighborhoods often lack any kind of park area for kids to play in.

Lowe's set peaked with his buoyant pop song, "Cruel to Be Kind," but also ranged from the slow, jazzy ballad, "You Inspire Me," to revved-up rockabilly on songs such as "Without Love" and "Go Away Hound Dog." He touched on career high points such as "What's So Funny ('Bout Peace, Love and Understanding)" - p pularized by Elvis Costello - and "When I Write The Book" (recorded with his former group  Rockpile), but devoted most of the show to newer material.

We suspect the same may be true for school shootings, as many school shooters have also committed suicide.

Perhaps most antithetical to our perception of pro athletes is the revelation that few of his teammates ever call. He's not close with any of them. Sports writers are, of course, as guilty as anyone for creating the idea that teams are "cohesive units" that thrive on "chemistry." These concepts aren't completely bunk, of course.

The fact of the matter is that Paterno did not witness anything. A graduate assistant came to his house in the middle of the night after supposedly witnessing the act to tell him about it. The assistant was the witness, the assistant should have stopped the act immediately and/or called the police. How do we know Paterno did not advise him to do this? After the fact what was Paterno supposed to do? Could the assistant even identify the child so the police could find him and corroborate his story? One other point to remember is that this all happened when Paterno was 74 years old, what frame of reference does he even have to be able to digest the story that a 28 year old graduate assistant has just told him? It seems that Sandusky is not a big enough fish for the press to fry so they need to drag Paterno into this mess.

It's going to be a vibrant, raucous audience.

Or is it? When I was in high school our church youth group used to sing a song lifted directly from the Hebrew scriptures: I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously. The horse and the rider thrown into the sea. It's taken from Exodus 15:21, the song Miriam s ng after the children of Israel not only crossed the Red Sea on dry land, but saw t e Egyptian army swallowed up behind them. It's a song celebrating the victory of the people of God, but it also celebrates the death of an untold number of Egyptians (and their horses). Singing that peppy little number never bothered me, perhaps because the Exodus was long ago and far away and clearly God's doing, besides.

Miller won't hear his name called as early as former Buffaloes offensive lineman Nate Solder, who was selected 17th overall by New England in the 2011 draft, but he could be a nice mid-round pick-up by a team looking for depth up front. Miller has great size and a work ethic that is just as big. The native of Littleton, Colo., graded out at 83.3 as a senior, allowing just one sack and committing two penalties. Miller was an All-Big 12 honorable mention as a junior after playing every snap on offense, starting all 12 games at right guard. He graded out at 88.9 percent and yielded two sacks that season while getting whistled for two penalties. Miller was granted an extra year of eligibility after missing a majority of the 2008 season with a broken fibula. He ha  long arms and does a nice job controlling defenders, but there are concerns that he could be at a leverage disadvantage in the run and pass game. Miller, though, has shown good footwork and can pull from the backside to deliver hits on targets. At the NFL combine  Miller recorded 32 reps in the bench press and showed some nice athletic ability in the vertical jump (28 inches) and bro d jump (100 inches).

As I said, I suppose there's an argument to be made that the early church allowed too much paganism into its practices. I'm not making that argument, but it can be made. What seems far more dubious to me is to assume that those practices, completely decontextualized from the ancient world, turn modern Christians into pagans. When a family gathers near their tree and sings "Happy Birthday" to Jesus, I don't think that worship is tr nsferred to an ancient solar deity. I don't want to speak for Jesus, but I think he knows what we're doing; he understands the intent of our hearts and our desire to celebrate his coming. And I can't imagine that the Unconquered Son. the one who is both Suffering Servant and King of Kings, is offended if we've gotten the day wrong. I'm petty about how my birthday is celebrated. I'm sure that Jesus is not.

Even if children and teens could be motivated to engage in some kind of phy ical activity, many schools have eliminated gym classes, and poor neighborhoods often lack any kind of park area for kids to play in.

I Twittered about that a little bit, just to say thank you to people. What happened is my fancy little car, which after 10 years of skating as a pro I bought for myself, leaked. It was a soft-top convertible, and it was parked on an incline, and there was a massive amount of water in the back. So being a country kid, I try to figure out how to solve this problem myself. So every once in a while, I'd go down in the garage and set up the leaf blower and just let the air blow underneath the carpets and dry it out, so that no mold would come into play. And the third day, my theory is that it was pretty dry, because something went wrong, either the leaf blower sparked, or it got overheated, or it slipped, because I had it tied it off so it wouldn't move, but maybe it plugged either one end or the other and overheated. My cellphone went off, so I left the garage so I could hear, and then I heard the garage door open. I thought, "That's really weird. Why would the garage door open?" I opened it up, and the car was engulfed in flames. The fire department was under restoration. They didn't come for about 16, 17, 18 minutes. And that was enough. The fire took hold from the basement into our living room, into our bedroom, into the roof and burned most of the roof off the house. And five and a half hours later, they had it under control. So I was just trying to get my car dry. It's dry now.

I am sur  that its replacement will be fine, but Doyle Drive was a marvel and unique. That horrible crash years ago with the drunk in the Porsche could have happened with or without a center barrier.

Well, not quite. There was nothing despicable about Clinton's ad, which simply implied that her superior experience in affairs of state made her the best person to h ndle a crisis. As the incumbent, Obama enjoys the same advantage over Romney, so it's little surprise that his campaign is making a big deal over his wise management of the Bin Laden operation. What makes the ad more than a little distasteful is its characterization of Romney's past statements, which are taken out of context to make it look as if he would 't have bothered pursuing the Al Qaeda mastermind.

Perhaps most antithetical to our perception of pro athletes is the revelation that few of his teammates ever call. He's not close with any of them. Sports writers are, of course, as guilty as anyone for creating the idea that teams are "cohesive units" that thrive on "chemistry." These concepts aren't completely bunk, of course. A team playing well is alm st always in sync. It's just that whatever magic exists on the court or field or rink s ays on the court or field or rink.

Obese kids today are already beset with the health problems facing obese 25-year-olds. Just recently, a new study found that type 2 diabetes, the variety associated with obesity, has started cropping up at an alar ing rate in kids.

•Act 2: DVRs begin to count. Or rather, the Nielsen ratings people start to count DVR usage. For years “The O fice” and “30 Rock” languished in the ratings, and the boost they got from time-shifting (not to mention rentals on iTunes) was crucial to their success.

What makes the ad more than a little distasteful is its characterization of Romney's past statements, which are taken out of context to make it look as if he would 't have bothered pursuing the Al Qaeda mastermind.

It's a song celebrating the victory of the people of God, but it also celebrates the death of an untold number of Egyptians (and their horses). Singing that peppy little number never bothered me, perhaps because the Exodus was long ago and far away and clearly God's doing, besides.

Obese kids today are already beset with the health problems facing obese 25-year-olds. Just recently, a new study found that type 2 diabetes, the variety associated with obesity, has started cropping up at an alar ing rate in kids.

Well, not quite. There was nothing despicable about Clinton's ad, which simply implied that her superior experience in affairs of state made her the best person to h ndle a crisis. As the incumbent, Obama enjoys the same advantage over Romney, so it's little surprise that his campaign is making a big deal over his wise management of the Bin Laden operation. What makes the ad more than a little distasteful is its characterization of Romney's past statements, which are taken out of context to make it look as if he would 't have bothered pursuing the Al Qaeda mastermind.

What seems far more dubious to me is to assume that those practices, completely decontextualized from the ancient world, turn modern Christians into pagans. When a family gathers near their tree and sings "Happy Birthday" to Jesus, I don't think that worship is tr nsferred to an ancient solar deity. I don't want to speak for Jesus, but I think he knows what we're doing; he understands the intent of our hearts and our desire to celebrate his coming. And I can't imagine that the Unconquered Son. the one who is both Suffering Servant and King of Kings, is offended if we've gotten the day wrong. I'm petty about how my birthday is celebrated.
